# Empathy

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).
Runs on Angular 18.1.1

## Development

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

To check the working of PWA first build the app by running `npm run build`. You can keep the build updating with every change, by running `npm run watch` instead. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

When the app is built, run `npm run pwa`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Deployment

The app is deployed on GitHub Pages as a static site.
To deploy from the current branch run:
`npm run deploy`
The app is available at [https://mariannajan.github.io/Empathy](https://mariannajan.github.io/Empathy).

* on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/MariannaJan/empathy) - `git@gitlab.com:MariannaJan/empathy.git` - this is the main project repository with the complete code. It is private and also contains project issues / plans.
